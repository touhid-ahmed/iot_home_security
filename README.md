# iot_home_security
## This repository contains an IoT based project on home surveillance. This project has been accepted in the 2020 6th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR). 

### Brief Overview
In this project, a real-time home surveillance system is designed that can be authorised and regulated remotely with the help of an Android application. The Android application provides useful features such as: Activation/Deactivation of the system, Password management, Live monitoring and Alert. The system utilises a real time database (Firebase) for transmitting and interpreting the communcation between the hardware and the software.
